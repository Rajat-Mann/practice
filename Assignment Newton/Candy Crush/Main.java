//John has N candies. He want to crush all of them. He feels that it would be boring to crush the candies randomly, so he devices a method to crush them. He divides these candies in minimum number of groups such than no group contains more than 3 candy. He crushes one candy from each group. If there are G groups in a single step, then the cost incurred in crushing a single candy for that step is G dollars. After candy from each group is crushed, he takes all the remaining candies and repeats the process until he has no candies left. He hasn't started crushing yet, but he wants to know how much total cost would be incurred. Can you help him?
